We don’t know anything about the data, so we are not sure how to assign the weights that would work in that particular case. One good way is to assign the weights from a Gaussian distribution. Obviously this distribution would have zero mean and some finite variance. Let’s consider a linear neuron:\n","\n","y = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wNxN + b\n","\n","With each passing layer, we want the variance to remain the same. **This helps us keep the signal from exploding to a high value or vanishing to zero** (Frequently asked interview question). In other words, we need to initialize the weights in such a way that the variance remains the same for x and y. This initialization process is known as Xavier initialization.
